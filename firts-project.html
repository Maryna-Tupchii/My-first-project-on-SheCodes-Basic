          Ukrainians constantly fight against any manifestations of tyrany and
          defend freedom. They have the courage to fight against all Russian
          forces on land, in the air and at sea. They have courage to go unarmed
          against Russian armored vehicles. Ukrainians convince and restore
          honesty in the world. <br />If everyone in the world had at least ten
          percents of the courage that Ukrainians have, there would be no danger
          to international law at all. There would be no danger to the freedom
          of the nation. <br />
          Be brave like Ukraine!
